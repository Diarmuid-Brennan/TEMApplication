# TEMApplication
Application to implement operations for a Text Editing Management Application
The Text Editing Management (TEM) application provides the user with options to add words, one by one into a list stored in the application. 
Update and Undo options are also provided to perform operations on words previously entered into the list. 
Update provides an option to change an existing word in the list while Undo removes the word currently stored at the top of the list from the list. 
Therefore, the words are erased in reverse order of their typing. The application also provides an option for the user to upload the list to a document. 
The operations implemented in the application are carried out using a linear linked structure. The application was developed using the C++ programming language.
